# A Navigation App in Androind Platform

> I started developing the app as part of my Advanced Driver Assistance Systems(ADAS) project.
  Currently its just a driving navigation application using Mapbox Navigation SDK.
  
- The app will detect your current location.
- The destination for the driving has to be either selected on the screen or address has to be inputed.

- This app uses two SDKs:
    Mapbox Navigation SDK for Android
      https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android
    Google Places API for Android
      https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-places
